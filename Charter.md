# Collective Hope/ Dream
We live in a world of increasing compute demand. The global cloud compute market is estimated at $500 billion and will be $1.5 trillion by 2030. Currently, much of the compute needs for businesses and startups are met by a handful of large cloud providers. Many fields and applications require significant computing power including AI, scientific research, finance among others and the need for expanded capacity is only growing. The objective of this paper is to brainstorm the creation of an open and decentralised computing network and take a DPI approach to unlocking access to compute-at-scale. 

This network of compute would bring many independent providers together on one availability marketplace and improve discoverability. Users of this infrastructure would have access to computing power and related services from any provider. The network would create an extension to the existing computing paradigm and promote decentralised data storage that helps with resilience and overall improved security. This approach can be adopted globally to make markets that offer resilient, interoperable and adaptable environments for innovation.

Scaling compute requires capital and specialised knowledge. Thankfully, due to the advancement of various hardware and software innovations, compute has largely followed Moore's law. The amount of capital and knowledge required to start a cloud has reduced dramatically, and will continue to do so in the near future. Hence, we believe that it is now feasible to create such a distributed network. 

Engage with this paper with an open mind, welcoming imaginative exploration over a critical evaluation stance. Likewise, take note of similar decentralised trends emerging in GPU.net and Salad.com. This paper is dedicated to supporting private innovation, particularly benefiting micro and smaller players. While government support is acknowledged, the primary focus is on nurturing a dynamic private sector environment, and discussing the essentials for their success - policy support, technology and infrastructure support, and financial tools among others.


# Next Commitments
<p> The [Concept Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZZd3d8CDu4qcZlrr_b3WW9QGVO-IPl2Ztph_8iQKlkc/edit?usp=sharing) will be published on the People+AI website in the first week of December 2023. The paper will be presented and discussed at Global Technology Summit in New Delhi on December 5th in a workshop.
<p> As we imagine this open network, we need expertise and skill-sets that contribute to the following calls-to-action. Please refer to the Open Questions section.

# Problem Statement/ Hypothesis
<p> Our hypothesis is three fold:

1. There is a need for a network where compute providers will be discoverable by customers.
2. There is a need for a unified interface where compute providers and users can interact with each other, that allows for pricing mechanisms, and allows provision and selling of computing infrastructure.
3. There is a need for a financial incentive structure built around encouraging new people to (1) come invest in this compute and (2) to use the compute.


# Open Questions 
### [Discussions tab can be used to answer these questions]
<p> Question 1: What do you like out of this proposal? And what do you wish to see?
<p> Question 2: What efforts can we undertake from a market-maker and policy perspective to accelerate and pilot this program? 
<p> Question 3: What are the concrete steps that we can to approach this globally? From the get go, how do we make this global initiative? Who are the global partners we can collaborate with?
